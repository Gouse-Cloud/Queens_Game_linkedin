Today I explored a fun and challenging game problem called the Queens Game — a puzzle that really pushes your recursion and backtracking skills to the next level! 🔁 Recursion 🔍 Backtracking 🧩 Problem-solving

💻 The idea is to determine whether two input strings can be interleaved in order to form a third string. The twist? Every character must be used, and order must be preserved — classic backtracking territory!

Input / Output Formate :

# Input Representing in the matrix formate with each island with same number
mm=[[1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4],
    [1,1,1,1,2,2,3,4,4],
    [1,5,5,3,3,3,3,3,6],
    [7,7,5,8,3,8,9,9,6],
    [7,7,5,8,3,8,9,9,6],
    [7,7,5,8,8,8,9,6,6],
    [7,5,5,5,7,6,6,6,6],
    [7,7,7,7,7,7,6,6,6],
    [7,7,6,6,6,6,6,6,6]]
# Output Matrix position of Queens
[[0, 3], [1, 8], [2, 0], [3, 4], [4, 7], [5, 5], [6, 2], [7, 6], [8, 1]]

🧠 Core Concepts Applied:

Recursive branching to explore combinations

Backtrack when a branch fails

Base case to stop the recursion when all paths are validated

✅ Implemented using clean and efficient Python code ✅ Optimized to avoid redundant calls ✅ Readable and ready to scale!
